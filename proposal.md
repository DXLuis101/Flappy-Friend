# Flappy Friends

## Repository
<[Link to my project's public GitHub respository](https://github.com/DXLuis101/Flappy-Friend.git)>

## Description
This project will consist at the press of a keyboard button to make to interact with the character by making it jump. This encompasses to game development, making it fairly relevant to the media and digital arts.

## Features
- Feature 1: Jump
	- By pressing a keyboard button, the character will jump. This is the main function of the game.
- Feature 2: Obstacle Collision
	- The obstacle will have its collision, meaning, if the player character hits it, then it's game over.
- Feature 3: Score Data
	- At the beggining of the game, the score will be displayed. By passing through the obstacles you gain score. When it's game over, the score saves the data of your highest score.

## Challenges
- I will need to research the usage of pygame. 
- Methods will be essential to this project, so having to apply them in the script is imperative.
- I will have to relearn and research on the topic of Graphics and OOP.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Having to recreate the Flappy Bird game means that I could achieve some skills that requires mild/heavy programming in a script. Ideally, I would like to gain technical skills in the field of programming arts of game development, so having to do the Flappy Bird game will result in programming skills.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The game (script) must at least have the player character jumping. Regardless, the obstacles and sidescroller background moving must be essential to this game (script). Assets like pictures, icons for player for the game are not necessary.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Implement the whole code.
  2. Create the player character functionality.
  3. Create obstacles with collisions that detects player.
  4. Making a sidescrolling background.

- Week 2
  1. Gather arts, such as assets for the player character and obstacles.
  2. Add a background.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Review all codes working properly.
  2. Polish script.
