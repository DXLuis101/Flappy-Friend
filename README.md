# Flappy-Friend
This is a recreated famous game called Flappy Bird. Equally to the game, the goal is to avoid obstacles as the player moves and gain a score. It took a while to implement all the functionality for the player to jump, the collisions on the obstacles, and update the score. The least variables to implement the game is the main menu, the icons and pictures to the game, and the personal score on the main menu.

To run this game, install pygame.

Enjoy and have fun playing this!
